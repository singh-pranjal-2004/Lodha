                   <p id="p4"> Isolation of elements in Chemistry class 12 aims to teach the students about various processes of
                    extraction of metals from ores. Very few metals such as the noble metals, i.e., Gold, Silver, and
                    Platinum etc. are present in their original metallic forms in nature. Metallurgy is the field of
                    science which deals with the extraction of metals from ores which are naturally found in the
                    environment.

                    Most of the elements especially metals are present combined with other elements and these are called
                    minerals. An element may combine with a variety of other elements to make myriad minerals but out of
                    them, only a few are viable sources of that metal. Such sources are called Ores.



                    The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are
                    found in the earth’s crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows
                    us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we
                    see in buildings and bridges. Ores consist of the desired metal compound and the impurities and
                    earthly substances called Gangue. The extraction of metals and its isolation occurs over a few major
                    steps:

                    Concentration of Ore
                    Isolation of metal from concentrated Ore
                    Purification of the metal</p>
